<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>


<b>Problem 1.</b>  (11 points) <b>A miscellany.</b>
<p>

<b>b.</b>
The <tt>insert</tt> operation negates each key before inserting it into
the min-heap.
The <tt>removeMax</tt> operation removes the minimum key from the min-heap
and negates it before returning it.
<p>

<b>c.</b>
Replace <tt>SensorIn</tt> with a stub that generates faked earthquake data.
<p>

<b>d.</b>
<tt>o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode()</tt>.
<p>

<b>e.</b>
Add a <tt>total</tt> field to the <tt>DList</tt> class that maintains
the sum of all the items in the list.
The method <tt>setItem</tt> and
every method that inserts or removes a listnode must
update <tt>total</tt> accordingly.
The <tt>average</tt> method returns <tt>total</tt> / <tt>size</tt>.

<b>c.</b>
Replace
<pre><tt>
    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {

with
<pre><tt>
    for (int j = i; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (j == 0 || arr[i] >= arr[j - 1]) {
</tt></pre>
<p>

<b>d.</b>
The variant with bucket sort uses &Theta;(<i>q</i>) additional memory, whereas
the variant with couting sort uses &Theta;(<i>q</i> + <i>n</i>)
additional memory.
<p>

<b>e.</b>
The input array has no duplicate keys.
<p>

<b>f.</b>
Its expected running time is in &Theta;(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>).
<p>

<b>g.</b>
Preprocessing part:
Sort the old integers (any way you like) and store them in an array.
Create an array of buckets (or counts), one for each old integer,
with each bucket having a queue that contains the old integer
(or each count being 1).
<p>

Online part:
For each new integer, use binary search on the array
to find the matching old integer.
The binary search tells us the index of that integer's queue.
Store the new integer in the corresponding queue (or increase its count).
After all the new integers have been processed,
walk through all the queues to generate the output list as in bucket sort
(or use the counts array as in counting sort to generate the output list).
<p>


<b>Problem 3.</b>  (10 points) <b>Splay Trees.</b>
<p>

<b>a.</b>
<img src="splay13.gif" width="192" height="222" border="0" align=top>
<p>

<b>b.</b>
<tt>find(1)</tt>, then <tt>find(3)</tt>.
<p>

<b>c.</b>
The worst-case running time is in &Theta;(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>).
<p>

<b>d.</b>
Create two modified <tt>find()</tt> methods
called <tt>findLeft()</tt> and <tt>findRight()</tt>.
Intuitively, <tt>findLeft(x)</tt> performs the same search as
<tt>find(x -</tt> &epsilon;</tt>)</tt> for
an infinitesimally small number &epsilon;.
How do we implement that?
The method <tt>findLeft(x)</tt> searches the tree for the key <tt>x</tt>.
Whenever it finds one, it goes to that key's left child
(because <tt>x -</tt> &epsilon; is less than <tt>x</tt>) and
continues to search for <tt>x</tt>.
<p>

The last node the search visits will be either
the leftmost <tt>x</tt> in the tree&mdash;that
is, the first <tt>x</tt> in an inorder traversal&mdash;or
the key immediately preceding the first <tt>x</tt> in the inorder traversal.
The method splays that node to the root.
After the splaying,
all the nodes in the root's left subtree are strictly less than <tt>x</tt>, and
all the nodes in the root's right subtree are
greater than or equal to <tt>x</tt>.
(The root itself could be either.)
<p>

Symmetrically, <tt>findRight(y)</tt> performs the same search as
<tt>find(y +</tt> &epsilon;</tt>)</tt> for
an infinitesimally small number &epsilon;.
The method <tt>findRight(y)</tt> searches the tree for the key <tt>y</tt>.
Whenever it finds one, it goes to that key's right child and
continues to search for <tt>y</tt>.
<p>

Now, we just modify the algorithm in Lecture 40 by replacing
the calls to <tt>find</tt> with <tt>findLeft(x)</tt> and <tt>findRight(y)</tt>.
<p>

<i>[Note:  this question was probably way too hard.
So we are also accepting answers that modify the data structure in minor ways.
The simplest one is to modify the splay tree so that
all the duplicate keys are stored in a single treenode,
in some sort of list.]</i>
<p>


<b>Problem 4.</b>  (5 points) <b>Disjoint Sets.</b>
<p>

<b>a.</b>
The worst-case running time is in &Theta;(<i>fu + f + u</i>).
(We accepted &Theta;(<i>fu</i>) for full marks,
but it's nice to write &Theta;(<i>fu + f + u</i>) because it encompasses
the cases where <i>u</i> = 0 as <i>f</i> approaches infinity
and vice versa.)
<p>

<img border="0" src="disjoint13.gif" width="294" height="291"><p>

<b>b.</b>
Assign each parent pointer a <i>timestamp</i>, an extra field in each node
that states the &ldquo;time&rdquo; at which
its parent reference was set to a non-null value.
Each <tt>union</tt> operation creates one non-null parent reference with
a timestamp.
The <tt>find</tt> operation never traverses a parent reference whose
timestamp is newer than the parameter <tt>time</tt>.
<p>


<b>Problem 5.</b>  (7 points) <b>Graphs.</b>
<p>

<b>a.</b>
The worst-case running time is in &Theta;(<i>ev</i><sup>2</sup>).
<p>

<b>b.</b>
First, here's a recursive algorithm for determining whether there is
a path of length <i>k</i> from a vertex <i>u</i> to a vertex <i>w</i>
in a graph <i>G</i> = (<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>).
The base case is <i>k</i> = 0, for which
a path exists only if <i>u</i> = <i>w</i>.
Otherwise (<i>k</i> > 0), for each edge (<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) &isin; <i>E</i>,
recursively determine whether there is a path of length <i>k</i> &ndash; 1
from <i>v</i> to <i>w</i>.
If any one of these edges has such a path, then
there is a path of length <i>k</i> from <i>u</i> to <i>w</i>.
<p>

(Of course, there are faster algorithms; we studied one in Lab 13.)
<p>

To determine if <i>G</i> has a cycle of length <i>k</i>,
call this algorithm once for each vertex <i>v</i> &isin; <i>V</i>,
each time asking whether there is
a path of length <i>k</i> from <i>v</i> to itself.
<p>

<b>c.</b>
Here are two acceptable answers.
<ul>
  <li>  Use an adjacency matrix of linked lists of edge weights.
  </li>
  <li>  Use a hash table to map vertex pairs to linked lists of edge weights.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>


<b>Problem 6.</b>  (7 points) <b>Increasing a Key in a Binary Heap.</b>
<p>

[<i>Note:  most student answers to this question were
more than twice as long as ours, and some were two full pages long.
Which makes this question an unusually excellent litmus test of
programming skill.
If you first solve it yourself, then carefully study our solution and
ask yourself why yours is longer,
you might learn a lot about how to be a better programmer.</i>]

<pre><tt>
  public void increaseKey(int newKey) {               // Increase key of this node to newKey.
    if (newKey <= key) return;                  // Method cannot be used to decrease the key.
    key = newKey;
    if ((left != null) && (key > left.key) && ((right == null) || (left.key <= right.key))) {
      key = left.key;
      left.increaseKey(newKey);
    } else if ((right != null) && (key > right.key)) {
      key = right.key;
      right.increaseKey(newKey);
    }
  }
</tt></pre>

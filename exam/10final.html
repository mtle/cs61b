<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>


<b>Problem 1.</b>  (8 points) <b>A Miscellany.</b>
<p>

<b>b.</b>
The graph of objects in the heap might be nearly strongly connected&mdash;for
instance, if almost all of the objects are nodes in a doubly-linked list.
Then, half the roots might lead to all the objects,
so garbage collection will be no faster than usual.
<p>

The solution doesn't work because the sweep phase doesn't know
which objects to sweep away if only some of the live objects are marked live.
<p>

<b>c.</b>
<tt>insert()</tt> may cause the array to run out of space,
forcing you to resize it.
<p>

<b>d.</b>
The maze graph is a <i>spanning tree</i> of <i>G</i>.
<p>

<b>e.</b>
If the team that implemented the graph ADT thinks of a better way to
implement the graph, they might change the <tt>VertexPair</tt> class,
thereby breaking the <tt>Kruskal</tt> application.
<p>


<b>Problem 2.</b>  (9 points) <b>Trees.</b>
<p>

<b>a.</b>
<img src="splay10.gif" border="0" align=top>
<p>

<b>b.</b>
No sequence of operations can construct this 2-3-4 tree.
In a valid 2-3-4 tree, every leaf is at the same level.
<p>

<b>c.</b>
<img src="bintree10.gif" border="0" align=top>
<p>

<b>d.</b>
Each node in the splay tree stores both a date and an exam score.
The <tt>insert</tt> method works as usual for a splay tree,
using the dates as the keys by which the nodes are ordered.
<p>

At each node in the tree, we store the size of the subtree rooted at that node
<i>and</i> the sum of the scores of all the exams in the subtree rooted
at that node.
During each splay tree rotation, we update the subtree sizes as described
in class, and we update the subtree total scores analogously:
the total score rooted at a node is the sum of its score
and its children's subtrees' total scores.
<p>

To answer an <tt>average</tt> query,
we determine the number of exams taken between
<tt>date1</tt> and <tt>date2</tt> (inclusive) as described in class.
Analogously, we also determine the sum of the scores of those exams.
Then we divide the total score by the number of exams.
<p>

Some details (not required for full marks,
as they repeat what was said in class):
The root node knows the size of the tree (number of exams stored in the tree)
and the total score of all the exams stored in the tree.
We query the number of exams in a range, and the total score in a range,
by subtracting the exams outside that range.
First we <tt>find(date1)</tt>, thereby splaying <tt>date1</tt> or
(if <tt>date1</tt> is not in the tree) a nearby date to the root.
Then we determine how many exams in the tree occurred before <tt>date1</tt>,
and their total score, by subtracting out the exams in the root's
left subtree and possibly in the root itself (depending on its date).
Then we <tt>find(date2)</tt> and subtract out the exams that
occurred after <tt>date2</tt>.
<p>

<b>e.</b>
Use a bucket sort that inspects only the first &lceil;log <i>n</i>&rceil;-bit
digit of each key, and
therefore uses 2<sup>&lceil;log <i>n</i>&rceil;</sup> buckets
(which is at least <i>n</i> and less than 2<i>n</i>).
To avoid the cost of copying long integers, we sort <tt>LongInteger</tt>
references instead of moving the integers themselves.
When a collision occurs&mdash;that is, when you insert a key into a bucket
that isn't empty&mdash;use insertion sort to enter the key in its proper
sorted position in the chain (linked list).
In other words, we enforce the invariant that each bucket's chain is
always in sorted order.
The insertion sort uses comparisons, but we rarely have to compare two keys
in their entirety; rather, we go from the most to the least significant digit,
and stop as soon as we find a digit where the two keys differ.
<p>

After placing every key in a bucket, concatenate the chains together
into a sorted linked list.
<p>

(Warning:  some students wanted to recursively sort the keys in each bucket
with further rounds of bucket sort.  But this is too expensive if you use the
same radix for every round of bucket sort!  Because you're always using
&Theta;(<i>n</i>) buckets, even just to sort two keys, the total expected
running time will be in &Theta;(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>).
Recursive bucket sorting can work, but only by reducing the number of buckets
in each recursive call to be roughly equal to the number of keys.)
<p>

This algorithm needs two randomized analyses.
First, what is the cost of comparing two keys (for insertion sort)?
It takes <i>O</i>(1) time to compare their second-most significant digits.
These will match with probability at most 1 / <i>n</i>, in which case
we must compare their third-most significant digits.
The second and third digits will match with probability at most
1 / <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>.
Continuing this logic, the expected time to compare two keys is in
<i>O</i>(1 + 1 / <i>n</i> + 1 / <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> + 1 / <i>n</i><sup>3</sup>
+ &hellip;) = <i>O</i>(1).
<p>

The second part of the randomized analysis is virtually the same as
for hash tables.
Suppose you insert a key <i>k</i> into a bucket,
when there are <i>m</i> keys already in the buckets.
Let <i>V<sub>i</sub></i> be a random variable that is 1 if
the <i>i</i>th key is in the same bucket as <i>k</i>, and 0 otherwise.
Because the expected cost of comparing <i>k</i> with another key is constant,
by the linearity of expectation, the expected cost of bucketing <i>k</i> is in
<blockquote>
<i>O</i>(1 + <i>V</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>V</i><sub>2</sub> + &hellip; +
<i>V<sub>m</sub></i>).
</blockquote>
Because the keys are random,
every <i>V<sub>i</sub></i> = 1 / 2<sup>&lceil;log <i>n</i>&rceil;</sup>
&le; 1 / <i>n</i>.
So the expected cost of bucketing <i>k</i> is in
<blockquote>
<i>O</i>(1 + <i>m</i> / <i>n</i>) = <i>O</i>(1).
</blockquote>
By the linearity of expectation, the expected cost of bucketing
all <i>n</i> long integers is in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>).

<b>Problem 4.</b>  (8 points) <b>Asymptotic Analysis.</b>
<p>

<b>a.</b>
20 log<sub>2</sub> <i>n</i> &isin;
&Theta;(log<sub>2</sub> (<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>)), because
log<sub>2</sub> (<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>) = 3 log<sub>2</sub> <i>n</i>,
which differs from 20 log<sub>2</sub> <i>n</i> only by a constant factor.
<p>

<b>b.</b>
<i>x</i> &isin; &Omega;(<i>x</i> sin <i>y</i>), because
<i>x</i> &ge; <i>x</i> sin <i>y</i> for all positive <i>x</i>.
We can't use &Theta; because sin <i>y</i> can be zero for arbitrarily large
values of <i>y</i>.
<p>

<b>c.</b>
10<i>n</i>! &isin; <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>), because
<i>n</i>! &le; <i>n</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>
(which is obvious if you write out all their factors).
We can't use &Theta; because
<i>n</i> &times; <i>n</i>! &le; <i>n</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>
(also obvious if you write out their factors and ignore the factor of 1 in the
first product).
Therefore, as <i>n</i> approaches infinity, the ratio
<i>n</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> / <i>n</i>! also approaches infinity,
and no constant can make up for that.
<p>

<b>d.</b>
<i>n</i>3<sup><i>n</i></sup> &isin;
<i>O</i>(3<sup><i>n</i> + log<sub>2</sub> <i>n</i></sup>), because
3<sup><i>n</i> + log<sub>2</sub> <i>n</i></sup> =
<i>n</i><sup>log<sub>2</sub> 3 </sup>3<sup><i>n</i></sup>,
which grows faster than <i>n</i>3<sup><i>n</i></sup> by a factor of
approximately <i>n</i><sup>0.58496</sup>.
No constant can make up for that.
<p>

<b>e.</b>
<i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) = 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> is one of many counterexamples.
(Observe that polynomials don't work; you need something faster-growing.)
<p>

By definition, 2<sup><i>cn</i></sup> &isin; &Theta;(2<sup><i>n</i></sup>)
if and only if there exist constants <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>N</i>
such that for all <i>n</i> &gt; <i>N</i>,
2<sup><i>cn</i></sup> &le; <i>a</i>2<sup><i>n</i></sup> and
2<sup><i>cn</i></sup> &ge; <i>b</i>2<sup><i>n</i></sup>.
<p>

The first of these implies that
2<sup>(<i>c</i> &ndash; 1)<i>n</i></sup> &le; <i>a</i>,
which is clearly not true for large <i>n</i> if <i>c</i> &gt; 1.
(Likewise, the second of these implies that
2<sup>(<i>c</i> &ndash; 1)<i>n</i></sup> &ge; <i>b</i>,
which is clearly not true for large <i>n</i> if <i>c</i> &lt; 1.)
<p>



<b>Problem 5.</b>  (4 points) <b>Set Intersection.</b>
<p>

<b>a.</b>
For each item in <i>T</i>, check if it's in <i>S</i> by binary search.
Write the common items to an output array.
The worst-case running time is in <i>O</i>(<i>t</i> log <i>s</i>).
<p>

<b>b.</b>
For each item in the <i>smaller</i> set,
check if it's in the larger set by hashing.
Insert the common items into a new hash table.
The expected running time is in <i>O</i>(min{<i>s</i>, <i>t</i>}).
<p>

<b>c.</b>
Store the elements of both <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> in the same hash table.
Each listnode in each chain must contain not only an element,
but also a flag specifying whether the element is in <i>S</i> or <i>T</i>
(or both, if you feel like merging their listnodes&mdash;it will work whether
you do so or not).
<p>

Also store a doubly-linked list containing the members of
<i>S</i> &cap; <i>T</i>.
This list must be maintained by the <tt>insert</tt> and <tt>remove</tt>
methods, because there won't be time to construct it when
an application asks for <i>S</i> &cap; <i>T</i>.
When an element is inserted into one of the sets,
we must check whether it is in the other set;
if so, add it to the doubly-linked list.
When an element is removed from one of the sets,
likewise check whether it is in the other set;
if so, remove it from the doubly-linked list.
To do that, we have to find its listnode in the doubly-linked list
in <i>O</i>(1) time.
Therefore, we must maintain an additional reference from each chain listnode
to the corresponding doubly-linked listnode
(which is <tt>null</tt> for elements not in <i>S</i> &cap; <i>T</i>).
<p>

Now, we can query <i>S</i> &cap; <i>T</i> in
<i>O</i>(|<i>S</i> &cap; <i>T</i>| + 1) time by
simply traversing the doubly-linked list.
<p>

(A good alternative solution uses a third hash table,
rather than a linked list, to store the intersection.
It's a little more complicated and slow than a linked list, but you don't need
to keep listnode references in the chains of the first two hash tables,
so in some ways it's more elegant.)
<p>



<b>Problem 6.</b>  (6 points) <b>Amortized Analysis of a Graph Algorithm.</b>
<p>

<b>a.</b>
<tt>mystery(i)</tt> deletes all the edges in the connected component
that contains vertex <tt>i</tt>.
Said differently, it deletes all the edges reachable from vertex <tt>i</tt>.
Said differently again, it deletes all the edges on paths that
contain vertex <tt>i</tt>.
<p>

<b>b.</b>
&Theta;(<i>e</i>).
<p>

<b>c.</b>
Every <tt>addEdge</tt> operation saves $9 in the bank.
A call to <tt>mystery</tt> runs in time proportional to
the number of edges it deletes&mdash;no more than $9 per edge,
since we choose the size of a dollar&mdash;plus some
constant number of dollars.
Say that the amortized cost of <tt>mystery()</tt> is that constant.
<p>

With this accounting, it follows by induction that the bank balance
is always at least $9 times the number of (undirected) edges in the graph.
That is, if this invariant holds before a call to
<tt>addEdge</tt> or <tt>mystery</tt>, it will hold after the call;
therefore it will hold after any number of operations.
<p>


<b>Problem 7.</b>  (7 points) <b>Treenode-and-Reference Disjoint Sets.</b>

    parent = parent.find();

  public void union(DSElement other) {
    DSElement thisRoot = this.find();
    DSElement otherRoot = other.find();
    if (thisRoot != otherRoot) {
      if (thisRoot.size > otherRoot.size) {
        otherRoot.parent = thisRoot;
        thisRoot.size += otherRoot.size;
      } else {
        thisRoot.parent = otherRoot;
        otherRoot.size += thisRoot.size;
      }

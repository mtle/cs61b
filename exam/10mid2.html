<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>

<b>Problem 1.</b>  (10 points) <b>A Miscellany.</b>
<p>

<b>a.</b>
Determining whether the graph contains a particular edge (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>).
Other acceptable answers include inserting an edge and deleting an edge.
A particularly interesting solution, contributed by one student on his exam,
is finding all the edges directed <i>into</i> a particular vertex.
This takes O(|<i>V</i>|) time with an adjacency matrix, and
O(|<i>V</i>| + |<i>E</i>|) time with an adjacency list.

<b>d.</b>  <tt>cdadcdad</tt>.
<p>

<b>e.</b>  Three acceptable answers (each worth full points):<br>
If any one of the characters is zero, the hash code is zero.<br>
Anagrams all have the same hash code.<br>
A string's hash code doesn't change if you insert characters equal to one.
<p>



<b>Problem 2.</b>  (8 points) <b>Algorithms.</b>
<p>

<b>a, b.</b>
With <tt>bottomUpHeap()</tt>, create a heap containing the <i>n</i> numbers.
This takes &Theta;(<i>n</i>) time.
Then, call <tt>removeMin()</tt> <i>j</i> times,
taking &Theta;(<i>j</i> log <i>n</i>) worst-case time.
The total worst-case running time is in
&Theta;(<i>n</i> + <i>j</i> log <i>n</i>).
<p>

An alternative solution uses a <i>max-heap</i>,
which reverses the heap-order property,
so that the greatest key is at the top of the heap.
Starting from an empty max-heap,
insert <i>j</i> keys (it doesn't matter which ones) into the heap.
Then repeat the following operations for each remaining key:
insert the key into the heap, and remove the maximum key from the heap.
After you've processed all the keys, the heap contains the <i>j</i> smallest.
At worst, this takes &Theta;(<i>n</i> log <i>j</i>) time.
<p>

The optimal solution&mdash;which requires knowledge you won't learn until
later in the semester&mdash;is to use a median-finding algorithm to find
the <i>j</i>th-smallest key in &Theta;(<i>n</i>) expected time.
Then, a linear scan through the array can find
the other <i>j</i> &ndash; 1 smallest items,
also in &Theta;(<i>n</i>) expected time.
<p>

<b>c.</b>  Output-sensitive.
<p>

<b>d.</b>
Starting from the root, walk down the tree.
When you encounter a key less than <i>k</i>, go right.
When you encounter a key greater than or equal to <i>k</i>, go left.
Repeat until you reach a null pointer.
(A useful intuition is that this is equivalent to performing
a <tt>find</tt> operation on the key <i>k</i> &ndash; &epsilon;,
where &epsilon; is infinitesimal.)
<p>

As you go down the tree, keep track of the largest key you've encountered
so far that's less than <i>k</i>.
When you reach a null pointer, return that value.
The tree might not contain any key less than <i>k</i>,
in which case you can return <tt>null</tt>
or some other value that means &ldquo;no such key.&rdquo;
<p>



<b>Problem 3.</b>  (7 points) <b>Sibling-based tree height.</b>
<p>

The main idea is that if <tt>this</tt> node has a next sibling, then
<tt>height()</tt> should return the <i>maximum</i> height of <tt>this</tt> node
and its siblings to the right.
This information allows the parent to calculate its height.
The other idea is to use a postorder traversal to calculate the heights.
<p>

<tt><pre>
public class SibTreeNode {
  public Object item;
  public SibTreeNode parent;
  public SibTreeNode firstChild;
  public SibTreeNode nextSibling;

  int height() {
    int h = 0;
    if (firstChild != null) {
      h = 1 + firstChild.height();
    }
    if (nextSibling != null) {
      int hSib = nextSibling.height();
      if (hSib > h) {
        return hSib;
      }
    }
    return h;
  }
}
</pre></tt>

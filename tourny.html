Enter the Network Tournament!</font>
<p>

The Network tournament will take place on
<b>Monday, May 5 from 7:00&ndash;10:00 pm</b> in <b>306 Soda Hall.</b>
The winning team will receive
<font color='9000ff'>gift certificates to Amoeba Records</font>.
Nobody is required to enter the tournament, but
we welcome all with working players to submit.  You are welcome
to make improvements to your <tt>MachinePlayer</tt> that were not in
your original Project 2 submission, but if you don't,
please give it a shot anyway.
<p>

The &ldquo;official&rdquo; deadline for submission is
the day before the tournament.
Late submissions will probably be accepted, but there are no guarantees.
Submissions after the tournament will not be eligible.


<h1>Submission</h1>

To prevent your submission from conflicting with other competitors'
submissions, we want you to put <tt>MachinePlayer.java</tt> and all the
<tt>.java</tt> files your <tt>MachinePlayer</tt> needs (except
<tt>Player.java</tt> and <tt>Move.java</tt>) into one package, called
<tt>cs61b**</tt>
(replacing the asterisks with your submitting partner's login id, and
dropping the hyphen).
This includes <tt>.java</tt> files in the
<tt>list</tt> package or other packages.
(These are the files that are most likely to conflict.)
<p>

<b>Make sure that <tt>cs61b**</tt> does <i>not</i> contain
<tt>Player.java</tt> or <tt>Move.java</tt>.</b>  These two
files should remain in the <tt>player</tt> package.
Every team's submission will
share the same copies of <tt>Player.java</tt> and <tt>Move.java</tt>.
Since you can't change
them, you can't submit them, but you should keep them in
the <tt>player</tt> package so
you can test that your <tt>MachinePlayer</tt> compiles correctly.
<p>

You will need to change all the files in the <tt>cs61b**</tt> package to
include the line &ldquo;<tt>package cs61b**;</tt>&rdquo;
(replaced with your login id).
If you want to have a <tt>list</tt> package inside the <tt>cs61b**</tt>
package, its files should include the line
&ldquo;<tt>package cs61b**.list;</tt>&rdquo;.
Packages that call that package will need to
&ldquo;<tt>import cs61b**.list;</tt>&rdquo;.
<p>

Also, you will need to add the lines
&ldquo;<tt>import player.Player;</tt>&rdquo; and/or
&ldquo;<tt>import player.Move;</tt>&rdquo; to
any file that refers to the <tt>Player</tt> or <tt>Move</tt> classes.
(Avoid using &ldquo;<tt>import player.*;</tt>&rdquo;, as that can cause
compilation problems due to conflicting <tt>MachinePlayer</tt> classes.)
<b>Make sure that none of your <tt>.java</tt> files imports
any package outside <tt>cs61b**</tt></b>, except <tt>player</tt>
or packages in the standard Java library.
<p>

Once you've made these changes, make sure that your <tt>MachinePlayer</tt>
still compiles.

<blockquote>
  <tt>javac -g cs61baa/*.java</tt> or, if you have packages,
  <tt>javac -g cs61baa/*.java cs61baa/*/*.java</tt>
</blockquote>

Then, make sure it still runs.  (See instructions below.)
<p>

Next, pick a team name.  Write a GRADER file with your team's name at the top.
You may also include details of your implementation (e.g. evaluation function,
search depth, how the early moves are chosen, other special tricks).  You're
not required to include anything more than your team's name, but if you win the
tournament we'll be asking how your MachinePlayer works.
<p>

Then submit by typing

<blockquote>
  <tt>submit tourny</tt>
</blockquote>


<h1>Pitting MachinePlayers Against Each Other</h1>

To help you compare different strategies, you can pit two different
<tt>MachinePlayer</tt>s against each other.
First, put each one in its own, differently-named package,
as per the instructions above.
For instance, one might be in the &ldquo;<tt>cs61byi</tt>&rdquo; package,
and one might be in the &ldquo;<tt>cs61bxq</tt>&rdquo; package or even in the
&ldquo;<tt>player</tt>&rdquo; package.  Both <tt>MachinePlayers</tt>
must use the <tt>Player</tt> and <tt>Move</tt> classes in the
<tt>player</tt> package.
<p>

With <tt>Network.class</tt> in your <tt>pj2</tt> directory, run

<blockquote>
  <tt>java Network cs61byi cs61bxq "Team America" Annihilators</tt>
</blockquote>

replacing the two ids with the names of the two packages you want to see
compete.
Either of the two ids can also be replaced with &ldquo;human&rdquo; (a human player),
&ldquo;random&rdquo; (a random player), or &ldquo;machine&rdquo;
(the MachinePlayer in the player package), as usual.
The team names are optional, and the quotes are only necessary when
you want a space or another difficult character in a team name.
<p>

You can also put a &ldquo;<tt>-q</tt>&rdquo; switch right after
the word &ldquo;<tt>Network</tt>&rdquo;,
which causes <tt>Network</tt> to quit immediately when the game ends.
This can be useful for batch testing.
<p>


<h1>Dedicated Machine for Timings</h1>

Instructional Computing has made the machine <tt>cube.cs.berkeley.edu</tt>
available solely for the tournament,
and for figuring out how much your <tt>MachinePlayer</tt>
can accomplish within the five-second limit.
It is available for login to cs61b accounts only.
<b>Please do not use the machine for any other purpose than
to time your one-parameter <tt>MachinePlayer</tt> and
ensure that it always returns a move within the five-second limit.
Please do not run text editors, the Java compiler, or anything but your
game-playing software on <tt>cube.cs.berkeley.edu</tt>.</b>
<p>

If something doesn't work as I've advertised, please let me know.
